🚀 **Proud to unveil my latest innovation — an Arduino-based Ultrasonic Radar System!**  

This project combines **ultrasonic sensing**, **embedded systems**, and **real-time visualization** to simulate a working miniature of a real radar mechanism. Built with an **Arduino Uno**, **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor**, and a **servo motor**, it scans its surroundings and displays detected objects on a dynamic radar interface — all in real time.  

But I didn’t stop at just building the hardware ⚡ — I also developed an **interactive website** 🌐 to showcase it in a creative and modern way:  
👉 **[uniqueradar.vercel.app](https://uniqueradar.vercel.app)**

## ✨ Features  
- 🔍 **Object detection** using ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)  
- 🔄 **180° servo-controlled scanning** for full sweep coverage  
- 🖥️ **Real-time radar visualization** (Processing / Python GUI)  
- ⚡ **Adjustable detection range** (up to ~4 meters)  
- 💾 **Full documentation and source code available**  
- 🎓 **Beginner-friendly and low-cost prototype**  

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements  
- Arduino Uno / Nano  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- SG90 / MG995 Servo Motor  
- Jumper wires & Breadboard  
- *(Optional)* LCD Display or PC for GUI visualization  

---

## 💻 Software Requirements  
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) — to upload microcontroller code  
- [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download) *or* Python — for radar visualization  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor between **0°–180°**.  
2. The sensor measures distance using ultrasonic pulses.  
3. The Arduino collects and transmits data to a computer.  
4. The visualization software (Processing/Python) displays **blips** on a radar-style interface.  

This creates a sweeping radar simulation that visually represents detected obstacles in real time.
