# 📡 Ultrasonic Radar System  

Ever wondered how radar works? 🚀 This project uses an **Arduino Uno**, **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor**, and a **servo motor** to build a mini radar system that scans its surroundings and visualizes detected objects on a live radar-style display. Perfect for beginners and enthusiasts to learn **object detection, embedded systems, and visualization** in a fun way!

## ✨ Features  
- 🔍 Object detection using ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)  
- 🔄 0°–180° servo-controlled scanning  
- 🖥️ Real-time radar-style visualization (Processing / Python GUI)  
- ⚡ Adjustable detection range (up to ~4m)  
- 🎓 Beginner-friendly and low-cost prototype

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements  
- Arduino Uno / Nano  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- SG90 / MG995 Servo Motor  
- Jumper wires & Breadboard  
- (Optional) LCD Display or PC for GUI  

---

## 💻 Software Requirements  
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) – to upload code  
- [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download) or Python – for radar visualization  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor across angles (0°–180°).  
2. At each step, the sensor measures distance using ultrasonic waves.  
3. The Arduino collects and sends data to the PC.  
4. Data is visualized as a sweeping **radar interface** where objects appear as blips.
